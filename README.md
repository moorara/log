# log

This package can be used for production-ready logging in Go applications.
It hides the complexity of configuring and using the state-of-the-arts loggers
by providing a **single interface** that is _east-to-use_ and _hard-to-misuse_!

## Supported Loggers

  - [go-kit](https://github.com/go-kit/kit/tree/master/log)
